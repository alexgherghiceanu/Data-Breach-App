Data Breach App

This project was developed with the help of my friends and colleauges during a 24h Hackathon style competition
called CyberHack. The main part was the integration of the Have I Been Pwned V3 api. Due to the short time
we had to complete the app, we decided to use as much of the API's functionality, alongide the site's data-base.
In an actual implementation with market-aplicability, an in-house data-base would be developed.

Features of the app:

   - Intuitive Graphic User Interface, built in python.
   - Ability to check your e-mails against known breach data-bases.
   - Ability to asses the security of your password.
   - A notification system that alerts the user when their e-mail has been breached.

Overall, it was a fun challenge and a first taste of the hackathon-style competition. The short deadline and competitive
atmosphere motivated me to push harder and dig deep within to create the best posible app.
